Hi, I'm Teenu ðŸ‘‹
I'm a web3 developer with a passion for all things crypto.
I love creating innovative solutions for the blockchain world,
and I specialize in developing crypto coins, decentralized exchanges, and dApps.

With several years of experience in web3 development,
I've honed my skills in Solidity, Ethereum, and various blockchain technologies.
I'm always learning and experimenting with new ideas to push the boundaries of what's possible in the world of decentralized finance.

Feel free to check out some of my projects, including my crypto coins and decentralized exchanges.
If you want to connect, collaborate, or just talk about the latest in the crypto world, feel free to reach out to me on social media twitter/email
